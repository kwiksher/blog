It is a significant project in which Brain corp's achievement was crucial, incorporating data from Macromedia's Director into the Solar2D/Kwik development environment and completing an interactive creation unchanged from that time. The original story and content are truly wonderful.

It is my pleasure to contribute to such a remarkable project. As a developer of [Kwik](https://kwiksher.com), a Photoshop extension that enables designers to create Solar2D games and storybook apps, I am thrilled to be part of this innovative journey with [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) which continues to exist as open-source.
