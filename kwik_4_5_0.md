## Github Sponsorship

Do you become a sponsor to Kwiksher?

I stopped a license sale. I would like to make Kwik5 on the new Adobe UXP platform rather than spending some time on marketing or promoting sales.

Kwik4 is a CEP plugin for Adobe Photoshop. It was made of a good jQuery library and JSX.

As of studying UXP platform for making plugins, I am prototyping Kwik5 with Vue or React on UXP now.
