I stopped a license sale. I would like to spend time on making Kwik5 on Adobe UXP platform rather than using time on marketing or promoting it.

Kwik4 is a CEP plugin for Adobe Photoshop. It was made of a good jQuery and JSX.

Adobe introduced UXP platform for making plugins. I will start a prototyping Kwik5 with Vue or React on UXP.
