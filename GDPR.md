GDPR has started today May 25, 2018

[Kwiksher's Privacy Policy](https://kwiksher.com/privacy-policy/) is updated and the site has a GDPR plugin for wordpress to handle the privacy settings.  You find the policy in the menu

If any issues with privacy handling, let me know via mail. I will continue to improve the site according to GDPR compliance

I looked up the following sites and articles about GDPR. FYI.
