* Are you planning marketing initiatives with your app?
* Free or Paid? Trial or In-App Purchase?
* iPhone/iPad only? Android devcies? PC and Mac?
* Sketch the workflow of the entire project
* Plan a schedule and due dates for each task, set each commitment as outputs

### Do a personal assessment?

## Quality Control
* Amazing illustrations but what are your weakness other than illustrating/drawing?
* Animatoins and intractive activites that enhance the experience?
* Professinal narration and sound effects?

## Avoiding "design on the fly"
* Traditinaly linear
* Non-linear: what defines the sequence?
* Game oriented: collect pieces and move accordingly
* Example: This Moster(linear), Stolen(mixed), Stranded(non-linear), Monsters VS Robots(linear-game oriented)

## Designing Scenes
* Thumbnail each scene
* board each scene
* Each PSD is a scene.

## Example
* Shows intro animation
* Read to Me / I Read options
* Shows witch playing
* Witch is thinking
* Allow users to switch languages
