## Disruptive Workflow
* **Disrupt** Traditional Publishing - not need to hire/ir staff up costly traditional programmers
* **Disrupt** Aspiring JK Rowling's authors don't need to learn how to code or pay publishers to get into the digital market. They get to keep major % share
    * DIY or hire a creator instead of a traditional programmer
    * better to ride on Kwik/Corona SDK in the cross platforms
* **Disrupt** creators or non-programmers earn by means of developing apps

## Corona SDK
* [The Best 15 Mobile Game Development Platforms & Tools in 2018](https://thetool.io/2018/mobile-game-development-platforms)

    Corona SDK is a cross-platform that uses the Lua scripting language which is pretty easy to learn and code with. You can make use of its 2D features and find many plugins in the Corona Market place. Corona is famous for their clear documentation and their supportive and active community. It also brings a real-time simulation that will help you to see how your app will look like after changes.

* [Top 5 Tools for Mobile Game Development](https://www.newgenapps.com/blog/top-sdk-tools-for-mobile-game-development)

    One downside with Corona is that it can only be used for 2D game development. It has limited to no capabilities in 3D gaming, VR or AR. If you are planning to create an AAA game then this platform might feel a little limiting.

    * [Comparison of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages)
        * Imperative
        * Object orientated
        * Functional
        * Procedual
        * Not Generic
        * Reflective
        * Not Eventdriven

    Lua doesn't have explicit "object" type (more general type of "table" is used for object definition), but does have explicit syntax for object method calling
