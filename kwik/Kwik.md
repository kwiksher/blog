## Solar2D Game Engine

https://solar2d.com/

* [Wikipdia Solar2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar2D)

    Solar2D (formerly Corona SDK) is a free and open-source, cross-platform software development kit originally developed by Corona Labs Inc. and now maintained by Vlad Shcherban.

* [The Best 15 Mobile Game Development Platforms & Tools in 2018](https://thetool.io/2018/mobile-game-development-platforms)

    Corona SDK is a cross-platform that uses the Lua scripting language which is pretty easy to learn and code with. You can make use of its 2D features and find many plugins in the Corona Market place. Corona is famous for their clear documentation and their supportive and active community. It also brings a real-time simulation that will help you to see how your app will look like after changes.

* [Top 5 Tools for Mobile Game Development](https://www.newgenapps.com/blog/top-sdk-tools-for-mobile-game-development)

    One downside with Corona is that it can only be used for 2D game development. It has limited to no capabilities in 3D gaming, VR or AR. If you are planning to create an AAA game then this platform might feel a little limiting.

    * [Comparison of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages)
        * Imperative
        * Object orientated
        * Functional
        * Procedual
        * Not Generic
        * Reflective
        * Not Eventdriven

    Lua doesn't have explicit "object" type (more general type of "table" is used for object definition), but does have explicit syntax for object method calling
